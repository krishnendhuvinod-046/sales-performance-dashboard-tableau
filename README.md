​📊 Business Revenue Optimization Dashboard
​An interactive Tableau solution for monitoring sales health and order fulfillment efficiency.
​🎯 Project Overview
​This project addresses the need for real-time visibility into sales performance. By transforming raw transactional data into an interactive dashboard, I've enabled stakeholders to monitor ₹15.4M in total revenue and track key performance indicators (KPIs) across different order lifecycles.
​🧪 Business Problem
​Stakeholders lacked a centralized view to distinguish between "Realized Revenue" (Delivered) and "Potential Loss" (Cancelled). This dashboard was designed to identify growth trends and evaluate the financial impact of order cancellations.
​🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
​Data Visualization: Tableau Public
​Data Processing: Excel (Data cleaning, handling null values, and formatting)
​Analysis: Trend Analysis, Categorical Breakdown, KPI Tracking
​Design: User-Centric Dashboard Design (UI/UX)
​📈 Key Insights & Impact
​Revenue Growth: Identified a consistent upward trajectory in monthly revenue, suggesting successful market expansion or seasonal demand spikes.
​Fulfillment Efficiency: Confirmed that the vast majority of revenue is driven by successfully delivered orders, indicating a healthy supply chain.
​Loss Mitigation: Determined that cancelled orders have a minimal impact on total revenue; however, I recommended further deep-dives into "Cancelled" reasons to optimize the customer experience.
