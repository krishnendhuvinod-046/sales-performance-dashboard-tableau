# 📊 Business Revenue Optimization Dashboard
An interactive Tableau solution for monitoring sales health and order fulfillment efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project addresses the need for real-time visibility into sales performance. By transforming raw transactional data into an interactive dashboard, I've enabled stakeholders to monitor **₹15.4M in total revenue** and track key performance indicators (KPIs) across different order lifecycles.

### 💡 Business Problem
Stakeholders lacked a centralized view to distinguish between "Realized Revenue" (Delivered) and "Potential Loss" (Cancelled). This dashboard was designed to identify growth trends and evaluate the financial impact of order cancellations.

## 📈 Key Insights & Impact
* **Revenue Growth:** Identified a consistent upward trajectory in monthly revenue, suggesting successful market expansion or seasonal demand spikes.
* **Fulfillment Efficiency:** Confirmed that the vast majority of revenue is driven by successfully delivered orders, indicating a healthy supply chain.
* **Loss Mitigation:** Determined that cancelled orders have a minimal impact on total revenue; however, I recommended further deep-dives into "Cancelled" reasons to optimize the customer experience.
